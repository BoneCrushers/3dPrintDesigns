# Amplifier Box

## Purpose

The amplifier box provides a tidy way to manage the amplifier circuitry.

The box contains mounting points for the four MAX98306 amplifier boards and also contains all of the wiring to connect the amplifiers to power and signal inputs and outputs.

## Parts needed

The links here may point to multiple quantities and sizes in kits. The quantity and size needed for the project are given. 

* 4x [MAX98306 amplifier boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/987)
* 2x [5 pin aviation connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GZJYC91)
* 4x [3.5mm panel mount jacks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C3RFHDC)
* 4x [3.5mm aux cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCFQ3MG)
* Some bits of wire to connect everything together inside the box
    * Suggestion: use [solder seal connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083LZS69N) to make joining wires easy with a [heat gun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VFY8THD).

## Measurements

* *Aviation connector*: 16mm (less than 18mm) hole needed in model. Set to 16.4mm for tolerance.
* *3.5mm connector*: 6mm (less than 8mm) hole needed in model. Set to 8.4mm for tolerance.
* *MAX98306 board*:
    * Mount hole size: 2.4mm
    * Center-to-center mount hole distance: 24mm
    * Edge to hole outer edge: 1.2mm
    * Edge to hole center: 2.4mm
    * 1.2 + 2.4 + 2.4 + 1.2 = 7.2mm
    * Inner edge of holes = 20.8mm = all good.
* *5.5/2.1mm barrel jack*: 
    * 11.6mm wide point, 10.3mm narrow point
    * Narrow points on *sides* to make jack "vertical"
